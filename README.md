# ardroid-export
simple OSC control for Ardour/Mixbus.
Ardroid-export is an Ardroid clone based on Lincoln Spiteri's "Ardroid".
Lincoln Spiteri published Ardroid at http://subversion.ardour.org/svn/thirdparty/ardroid/.
This repo based on his old code. I port the project from eclipse to android-studio and improve it a little bit.
